## 3.Workflow

### Github
We are a group of 2 (Maurice, Nathan). First we chose a fun dataset with a lot of challenge in it. So here the challenge was mainly cleaning and making the data usefull to plot. A lot of time was invested in making the data ready to plot. This was the focus of the excercise because we felt like plotting was less of a problem for us.
